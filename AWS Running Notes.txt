VPC: A cloud based datacenter where you can deploy your Servers 

Subnet: Which help you to get register with AZ as well as making a small pieces of networks in your VPC.

Please remember: We can create many Subnets in single AZ but we cant create many AZ in single Subnet.


CIDR Format - X.X.X.X/X
Manual Subnet Formula 2 ^ (32 - ??) = 2 ^ ? = ???

https://www.site24x7.com/tools/ipv4-subnetcalculator.html
[2:45 AM, 1/6/2021] Mahesh@AWS TRAINER: What is IPv4 and IPv6?
IPv4 is 32 bit binary number while IPv6 is 128 bit binary number address. 
IPv4 address are separated by periods while IPv6 address are separated by colons.
Example:
IPv4: 10.0.0.165
IPv6: 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:7879
[2:45 AM, 1/6/2021] Mahesh@AWS TRAINER: There is fixed 5 IP reservation upon each subnet creation, purpose of each: 

1st IP - Network address 
2nd IP - Reserved for VPC Router
3rd IP - Reserved by AWS for mapping to the Amazon-provided DNS
4th IP - Reserved for future purpose
5th IP (Last IP of your Subnet) - Network broadcast address. We do not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore we reserve this address

				when you create VPC, is there any sub components are creating automatically ????
				
				DHCP Options set 
				Main RT 
				Main NACL

			what happened to Private Subnet ??
			how many ways ??
			
			
			Private subnets servers wants to download patches from internet ???
			
			there is on VPC already created who has created?
			
			can I delete?
			can I launch my prod servers in "that" VPC
			
			COnluclusion of Lab 1 ::: VPC 
			
			Intro to Lab 2 *


Assignment 1 >>>>> 
			
			1 - 3 Regions 
			2 - Launch 3 VPC in that 3 Regions but*** 
			3 - THree diff CIDR Range 
			4 - FIrst VPC 
							- 3 Subnets 
							- 2 Must be same, equal size, 1 can be diff size 
							
			5 - Second VPC 
							- Two equal subnets 
							- Delete the 2nd Subnets 
							- and than make that range into two equal subnets 
			6 - Third VPC 
							- Create 4 equal Subnets 
							- Delete 4th subnet and leave it as it is.
